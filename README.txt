Personal Portfolio Webpage. A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/SW1992/pen/NNGEjZ.

Built with HTML & CSS, Bootstrap & the Font Awesome CSS framework.

The NavBar also had plugin dependencies, for which I Loaded external Javascript in the form of jQuery & Bootstrap JS.

I will continue to update this page as i have more projects to add :).

This is a FreeCodeCamp Zipline project. https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage
